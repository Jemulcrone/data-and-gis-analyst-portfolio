Cyclistic Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study 


The purpose of this analysis is to determine how annual and casual riders use Cyclistic Bikes differently in order to lay the groundwork for a marketing plan to convert more casual riders into annual riders. I chose this project as a guided capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate because I wanted to work with a large data set and because of the spatial aspect of the bike trips. R was used for this analysis, though I also checked my data cleaning in Excel and SQL. I performed the suggested explorations around ride length trip day-of-week, then expanded the analysis to include questions about bike type and starting stations to address questions that arose about tourism. Results are presented in an R Markdown file that also provides a more in-depth project overview, description of data sources, and summary of data cleaning and analysis.
