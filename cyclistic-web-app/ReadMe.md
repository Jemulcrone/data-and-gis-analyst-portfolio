# Cyclistic Start Stations Bonus Web App üó∫Ô∏èüåÜ

## Overview:

The purpose of these web apps is to explore differences in geographical patterns between the casual rider and member user bases of Cyclistic Bikes by looking at the number of trips beginning at each of Cyclistic's thousands of docking stations and how that station popularity changes throughout a year. Data was manipulated in R, turned into a geographic shapefile in ArcGISPro coordinates, then uploaded into ArcGISonline to create an interactive app. More details are available in the ArcGIS story map linked below.

## My Favorite Part of this Project:

I love how time lapse visualizations and interactive elements add dimension to data stories. Deciding what information would benefit the most from the added functions was a great excercise, and I was happy to learn new useful information from the maps that were not in the original report (such as the popularity of docking stations around The University of Chicago for members). I also enjoyed putting my own geographic spin on the capstone project for a data analytics course!
