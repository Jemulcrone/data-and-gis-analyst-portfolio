# Cyclistic Start Stations Bonus Web App :bike: üó∫Ô∏èüåÜ

## Overview:

The purpose of these web apps is to explore differences in geographical patterns between the casual rider and member user bases of Cyclistic Bikes by looking at the number of trips beginning at each of Cyclistic's thousands of docking stations and how that station popularity changes throughout a year. Data was manipulated in R, turned into a geographic shapefile in ArcGISPro coordinates, then uploaded into ArcGISonline to create an interactive app. More details are available in the ArcGIS story map linked below.
