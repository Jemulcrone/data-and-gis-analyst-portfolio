# Cyclistic Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study :bike:

## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how members and casual riders use Cyclistic Bikes differently in order to lay the groundwork for a marketing plan to convert casual riders into members. I chose this as a guided capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate because I wanted to work with a large data set and for the spatial aspect of the trips. R was used for the analysis and data cleaning was checked in Excel and SQL. I performed the suggested explorations around ride length trip day-of-week, then expanded the analysis to include questions about bike type, and start stations to address questions that arose about tourism. Results are presented in an R Markdown file which provides a more in-depth project overview, description of data sources, and summary of data cleaning and analysis.

## My Favorite Part of this Project:

Transforming millions of rows of data into visuals that told a compelling story felt powerful. This was a guided project for a certificate, and exploring the suggested analysis easily led to a new set of questions. Thinking about the best approach to breaking down data to generate informative results is a process that I really enjoy, and comparing that processes in business analysis to the scientific analysis I'm most used to helped me to better understand both.
