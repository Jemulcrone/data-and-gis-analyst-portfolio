## Task: 

To determine if elevated-lipid sugarcane lines decompose differently than wild type sugarcane. Results will provide insight into sugarcane lipid decomposition and determine possible ecological and environmental impacts of growing elevated-lipid sugarcane crops. 

## Overview:

Energy crops such as sugarcane are engineered to contain higher lipid contents (up to 3% lipid as opposed to .25%) in order to provide more oil per plant. Plants with elevated lipid content may affect soil organic matter (SOM) through a variety of mechanisms including decomposition rate. It is possible that high-lipid sugarcane material would decompose more slowly than wild-type due to the lower quality lipid substrates. 

Leaf and root litter bags from three sugarcane lines (one wild type [WT], two elevated-lipid [17T and 1566]) were deployed at the University of Illinois Energy Farm in Urbana, IL, USA and collected in subsets at several intervals throughout the year. Mass lost from these bags was measured, corrected for soil contamination, and combined with carbon and nitrogen data from an elemental analyzer to determine differences in mass lost and percent decomposition of nutrients across lines. 

## Data Sources:

Mock data that was used to check the R script is used in this analysis for confidentiality reasons. A link to the paper with the real-world data will be updated when forthcoming and published. 

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation: 

Libraries were imported and working directory was set. 

```{r setup 2, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r libraries, results = "hide"}

library(readxl)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

```

Three types of data were imported: 
1.	Litter bag weights at each retrieval.
2.	EA data for percent carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in each sample at each retrieval as well as soil and stock litter. 
3.	Ashing data describing percentage of sample at each retrieval that is litter (organic matter) vs soil contamination, and the organic matter percentage of each soil sample. 


```{r import, results = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, attr.input='style="max-height: 100px;"'}

data.soil <- read_excel("sugarcane_C_N_mock.xlsx", sheet="cn_soil")
```

Soil ashing data reps were averaged then split into soil contaminating root samples and soil contaminating leaf samples. Unnecessary columns were deleted.

```{r average and split soil}
mean.soilash <- summarize(group_by(data.percentashsoil, Obs,
                                   litter_source, block, Sample_ID),

mean.soilashleaves <-filter(mean.soilash, grepl("leaf", Sample_ID))

mean.soilashroots <- filter(mean.soilash, grepl("root", Sample_ID))
```

Leaf and root ashing data reps were averaged then split between samples and stock. Unnecessary columns were deleted and the stock mean column was renamed to differentiate from sample mean columns. 

```{r clean leaf and root ash}

## Key Questions:

1)	Do elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf samples decompose more slowly than wild type?
2)	Do elevated-lipid sugarcane root samples decompose more slowly than wild type? 
3)	Does the carbon in elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf or root samples decompose differently than wild type? 
4)	Does the nitrogen in elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf samples decompose differently than wild type? 
5)  Are there concerning outliers in the data?

## Analysis, Key Results, and Visualizations: 

Percent actually litter (as opposed to soil) was calculated using Equation from literature for leaves and roots (Blair et al. 1988 sBB, DOI:10.1016/0038-0717(88)90154-X). 

```{r perc actually litter equation calcs}
litterleaf.compiled <- litterleaf.compiled %>% 
  mutate(percent_actually_litterleaf
         =(((100-mean_leafash) - (100-mean_soilash))
           / ((100-mean_stockleafash) - (100-mean_soilash))
           *100))

litterroot.compiled<- litterroot.compiled %>% 
  mutate(percent_actually_litterroot
         =(((100-mean_rootash) - (100-mean_soilash))
           / ((100-mean_stockrootash) - (100-mean_soilash))
           *100))
```


Percent of sample decomposed was calculated for leaves and roots. 

```{r merge wight data with perc actually litter}
# merge weight data from retrieved sample bags with the percent actually litter data

litterleaf.compiled <-merge(data.leafweight, select(litterleaf.compiled, -c(Obs.x, Obs.y, litter_date)),
                            by = c("litterbag_number", "litter_source",
                                   "litter_line", "block"))

litterroot.compiled <-merge(data.rootweight, select(litterroot.compiled, -c(Obs.x, Obs.y, litter_date)),
                            by = c("litterbag_number", "litter_source",
                                   "litter_line", "block"))

# multiply percent actually litter by weights of retrieved sample bags and subtract results from initial weight

litterleaf.compiled <- litterleaf.compiled %>% 
  mutate(post_weight_thats_actually_litter
         = (post_litter_wt_g * percent_actually_litterleaf/100))

litterleaf.compiled <- litterleaf.compiled %>% 
  mutate(pre_minus_adj_post
         = (pre_litter_wt_g - post_weight_thats_actually_litter))

litterroot.compiled <- litterroot.compiled %>% 
  mutate(post_weight_thats_actually_litter
         = (post_litterbag_wt_g * percent_actually_litterroot/100))

litterroot.compiled <- litterroot.compiled %>% 
  mutate(pre_minus_adj_post
         = (pre_litter_wt_g - post_weight_thats_actually_litter))

# divide adjusted post weight by initial weight

litterleaf.compiled <- litterleaf.compiled %>% 
  mutate(pct_mass_lost_leaf
         = (pre_minus_adj_post / pre_litter_wt_g))

litterroot.compiled <- litterroot.compiled %>% 
  mutate(pct_mass_lost_root
         = (pre_minus_adj_post / pre_litter_wt_g))
```

Leaf data was split between chamber grown and field grown.

```{r split leaf data between chamber and field}
litterleafcham01.compiled <- filter (litterleaf.compiled, 
                                     litter_source == "cham_01")

*Do elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf samples decompose more slowly than wild type?*
*Do elevated-lipid sugarcane root samples decompose more slowly than wild type?*

**Elevated-lipid sugarcane leaves decompose faster than wild type.** Both the 17T and 1566 lines had a higher percent mass lost at each timepoint. **Elevated-lipid sugarcane roots sometimes composed faster than wild type and sometimes slower.** The 1566 line had higher percent mass lost than WT at all time points while the 17T line had lower percent mass lost at all time points.

*Does the carbon in elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf or root samples decompose differently than wild type? Does the nitrogen in elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf samples decompose differently than wild type?*

**The carbon and nitrogen in elevated-lipid sugarcane leaf and root samples decompose more quickly than the carbon and nitrogen in wild type litter.** Patterns for graphs are identical because of the simplicity of mock data set to confirm different elements of the script.

*Are there concerning outliers in the data?*

**There are no concerning outliers in the data.** The box plots results are lines rather than boxes because mock data percent mass lost is the same for each litter line and type combination at each retrieval time. 


## Conclusions and Recomendations: 

Results show that in leaves, wild type sugarcane litter decomposes more slowly than elevated-lipid litter. This was the opposite of the experiment's hypothesis. In roots, wild type sugarcane litter decomposed more quickly than one of the elevated-lipid lines and more slowly than the other. If the lower quality lipid substrate is slowing down decomposition, other factors may be counteracting the effect as decomposition involves many interconnected steps. 

Carbon and nitrogen in both leaves and roots decomposed more quickly in elevated-lipid lines than wild type. These results support the experiment's hypothesis, but do not immediately explain the results of overall faster decomposition in wild type litter. These results could point to litter elements other than carbon or nitrogen making up the bulk of decomposition (although carbon decomposing in an opposite pattern to overall litter weight is unlikely to occur in real-world data). When analyzing real-world data, the carbon and nitrogen relative percentages may indicate which steps of the decomposition process are driving results. 

The data showed no concerning outliers and produced the expected results, indicating that the script is performing the desired calculations.
