Sugarcane Decomposition

The purpose of this project is to determine if elevated-lipid sugarcane lines decompose differently than wild type sugarcane and provide insight into the ecological and environmental impacts of growing elevated-lipid crops. The script processes mass lost data from experimental litter bags, corrects for soil contamination, and combines those results with carbon and nitrogen elemental analyzer data to determine differences in mass lost and percent decomposition of nutrients across lines. Mock data created to check the R script is used in this version of the analysis due to data confidentiality. A link to the paper with the real-world data will be updated when published. Results are presented in an R markdown file that has a more in-depth project overview and summaries of data manipulation and analysis.
