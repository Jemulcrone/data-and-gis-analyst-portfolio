# Data and GIS Analyst Portfolio :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## About

Hi! My name is Jess and I'm a Senior Research Specialist with 10+ years of experience working in ecology and soil labs interested in a career focused on data analytics. This portfolio contains projects I've completed using R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, ArcGISpro and ArcGISonline. I enjoy working with scientific, spatial, and market datasets, each of which is represented here. My favorite part of the analytic process is deciding which questions best address the task at hand and how to break data down to find stories, and I also love tackling the challenge of communicating findings through effective visualizations. I'm excited to share some of what I've been working on here! Thanks for checking out my projects and please feel free to [reach out](#contact-info) with any questions or thoughts.

## Portfolio Projects

## Carbon Credits :earth_americas:

### Overview: 

This project explores the distribution of voluntary carbon credits creation across the U.S. and investigates differences between the states generating large and small numbers of credits in order to understand potential drivers of credit creation.

## Quirky Craftopia :sunny:

### Overview: 

This project compares Quirky Craftopia farmer's market sales to weather and attendance to determine if either condition predicts high profit days. Total sales are then broken down by item type to see which products drive profit and therfore where variety and inventory increases may have the largest impact.

## Sugarcane Decomposition :leaves:

### Overview: 

This project compares elevated-lipid sugarcane decomposition rates with wild-type to determine the effect of increased lipid concentrations on the decomposition processes and provide insight into the ecological and environmental impacts of growing elevated-lipid crops. 

#### [Sugarcane Decomposition Report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Jemulcrone/data-and-gis-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/sugarcane_decomp-r/sugarcane-markdown.html)
