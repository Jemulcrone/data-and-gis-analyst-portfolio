# Voluntary Carbon Credits by State <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/link-to-your-image.png" width="200" />


## Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore the voluntary carbon credit database and state emissions records on a state-by-state basis. I also break down credit data at a project level and explore the Sustainable Agriculture category. I chose this topic to familiarize myself with the make-up of the carbon credit market firsthand and to answer specific questions I'm interested in about what project type spread looks like in states and across the country. The analysis begins by looking for geographic and correlation patterns of carbon credit production and emissions changes, then breaks down credits by project type and developer. The report looks at these breakdowns through choropleth maps, matplot graphs and plots, and tables.  Data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis was done in Jupiter notebooks and results are presented in a markdown file that contains a more in-depth overview of the project, summary of data manipulation and analysis, and data source information.
