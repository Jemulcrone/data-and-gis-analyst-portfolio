# Quirky Craftopia Farmer's Market Sales Analysis ☀️:

## Overview: 

My friend Lorena has an Etsy shop called Quirky Craftopia and sells goods from the store at the Urbana, IL, Farmer’s Market, including scrunchies, bowl cozies, headbands, coasters, and more made from fun and colorful fabric patterns. She is moving an hour away to Bloomington, IL, but plans to continue selling at the Urbana market part-time and is wondering what factors might help determine the most profitable weekends to make the trip. In addition, Lorena has limited time to create inventory and has observed that sales for a particular product increase with the number of pattern options available. She would like to know which product or products she should focus on creating to take advantage of this effect, and if the answer varies over the season. To figure this out, I connected the Quirky Craftopia's Inventory Google sheets to Tableau and created a live dashboard of sales, weather, and attendance trends, and also visualizations of individual product sales compared to overall sales. The results were surprising! Findings are presented in a pdf report with a more in-depth overview, visualizations, and recomendations.

## My Favorite Part of this Project: 

Making a live dashboard was exciting and it's fun to check when I return from helping at the Farmer's Market to automatically get a sense of the week's sales. I'm looking forward to exploring automation by adding data scraping for weather to the board. It was satisfying to produce results that directly impact my friend's business decisions. I liked exploring Tableau's graphing and organization options and am a fan of the interface.
